# PedestrianDetection
Software application for a pedestrian detection system, implemented on Linux Environment under the hardware system running on Terasic's De1-SoC development board.
This, combined with the FPGA Design for pedestrian detection system were implemented for the purposes of Master Thesis @ University of Patras, Greece. Link to Master Thesis: http://hdl.handle.net/10889/12241

The FPGA design can been found on https://github.com/PhilipChalkiopoulos/DE1_SOC_PedestrianDetection
